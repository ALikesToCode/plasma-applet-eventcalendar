          <h2>Privacy</h2>
          <p class="status">
            By downloading the widget from the KDE panel directly, you are downloading from the KDE Store which has a
            privacy policy at
            <a href="https://store.kde.org/privacy">https://store.kde.org/privacy</a>.
            By downloading the widget from Arch Linux's AUR, you are downloading from GitHub which has their own privacy
            policy.
          </p>
          <p class="status">
            The widget developer has access to the number of downloads for each release of the widget. The developer
            does not have access to where each download originates.
          </p>
          <h2>Google</h2>
          <p class="status">
            By default the widget will not connect to the Google Calendar API. You need to click a link in the widget's
            config that will open up a login form in your web browser.
            Once you have logged in, it will give you a "login code" to paste into the widget. The widget will then
            fetch your calendar, event, and task data from the Google Calendar
            and Google Tasks API. This data will be displayed in your KDE Plasma panel. The widget will periodically
            synchronize this data in order to keep it up to date.
            The user can also manually synchronize the data. The widget will store a cached list of your
            events/calendars/tasks locally on your computer so it can fallback to the
            cached copy when your PC is offline. The widget will also store a login/refresh token in your widget config
            <code>~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc</code> so you do not need to login every time you
            restart KDE Plasma. You may wish to read Google's privacy policy if you have not already.
          </p>
          <p class="status">
            The developer has access to Google API's application metrics for this widget. This allows the developer to
            see the total number of correct API responses, or errors,
            broken down by action. Some example actions are "fetch all calendars", "fetch all events", "create event",
            "delete event". The totals are not broken down by user.
            Each action has a sum of requests by all users. This is useful for knowing how close to the Google API quota
            the widget is, and if there are any spikes in errors.
            The errors are displayed as HTTP Error codes and do not expose any personal data to the developer.
          </p>
          <h2>OpenWeatherMap</h2>
          <p class="status">
            By default the widget will not connect to OpenWeatherMap.org. You need to manually select your city in the
            widget's config. Once you have selected a city,
            you will then fetch the current weather forecast every hour. OpenWeatherMap will be able to know the city
            you requested as well as your IP address.
            You may wish to read OpenWeatherMap's privacy policy as well.
